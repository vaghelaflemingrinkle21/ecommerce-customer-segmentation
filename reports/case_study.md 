# Customer Segmentation Case Study – Online Retail

## 1. Business Context

The company is a UK-based online retailer of unique gifts, operating primarily in Europe. Management wants to move from one-size-fits-all email campaigns to personalized marketing based on customer behavior and value.

## 2. Objective

Design and implement a data-driven customer segmentation framework that:
- Groups customers into meaningful behavioral/value-based segments.
- Supports targeted campaigns with measurable uplift.
- Can be operationalized in existing BI and CRM tools.

## 3. Data

- Source: Online Retail II (UCI)
- Timeframe: 2009–2010
- Level: Invoice line items
- Key raw fields: Invoice, InvoiceDate, StockCode, Description, Quantity, Price, Customer ID, Country

## 4. Approach

1. **Data preparation**
   - Filtered to valid customer transactions (no missing IDs).
   - Removed returns, cancellations and non-product lines.
   - Calculated line-level revenue and total revenue.

2. **Feature engineering**
   - Aggregated to customer level using RFM and additional behavioral metrics:
     - Recency, Frequency, Monetary
     - Product diversity, average order value
     - Purchase span and tenure

3. **Segmentation**
   - Built RFM-based rule segments as an interpretable baseline.
   - Standardized features and ran K-means clustering.
   - Selected K using elbow and silhouette methods.
   - Profiled clusters to create human-readable segments.

4. **Delivery**
   - Exported a customer-to-segment mapping as CSV.
   - Built a Tableau dashboard to explore segments and KPIs.

## 5. Key Insights (example – adjust to your actual results)

- A small group of **High-Value Loyalists** generates a disproportionate share of revenue and shows broad category engagement.
- A meaningful **Growth Potential** group consists of newer, high-spend customers who haven’t yet built long tenure.
- **Price-Sensitive Regulars** buy often but at lower average order values, driven by specific product types.
- **One-Time Seasonal** shoppers cluster around key calendar periods and categories.
- **At-Risk / Dormant** customers include previously valuable buyers whose recency has deteriorated sharply.

## 6. Recommended Actions

- Develop VIP programs and exclusive offers targeted at High-Value Loyalists.
- Build structured onboarding and educational journeys for Growth Potential customers.
- Use discount and bundle mechanics for Price-Sensitive Regulars to gently increase basket size.
- Schedule targeted seasonal reminders for One-Time Seasonal shoppers aligned to their historical patterns.
- Run A/B-tested win-back campaigns for At-Risk / Dormant customers, and track uplift by segment.

## 7. Impact & Next Steps

- The segmentation provides a reusable foundation for lifecycle marketing and CRM.
- Future work could connect segments to actual campaign performance data to quantify uplift and refine strategies.
